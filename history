When I discover dot Net technologie, I write a FTP client
(http://www.bubulemaster.fr/download/old/leechdotnet/).
After, I write a FTP server (same web address).
But, problem, it was slow and dot Net technologie is copyrighted by
Microsoft.
Client and server work with Mono (http://www.mono-project.com) but without
guarantee of Microsoft forbid Mono.

For my personnal use, I use TYPsoft FTP Server. But, two problem. First, a
author post say the next version not open source due to some close source
component. Second, since one year (maybe more), TYPsoft FTP Server web site
are closed.

I love Pascal language. And I decide to write my own FTP server. I search, and
I discover Synapse library (http://ararat.cz/synapse) and LNet library
(http://lnet.wordpress.com/).
I have all key to write easily an open source FTP server.

I decide to use Synapse library cause we found more documentation. LNet is good
cause is more platform independant (Linux, Window, Win CE, Mac OS X) but few
documentation and no new version since more one year.
