Thanks for choose PPFtp Server.

Directory "conf" have defaut configuration. You can change directory path by
program switch.
In this directory, you can found "ftp.access". This is an example of file to
change restrict right for a directory.
For example. If user "blabla" can create directory and you want no ftp user
create a directory in "/tmp", you can put "ftp.access" file in this directory
and retrict rights.
DON'T FORGET. If file "ftp.access" file is readonly, directory who contain this
file can't remove cause this file can be deleted by DELE FTP command ! Only
RMD/XRMD can delete this file.

For users (create or delete), just copy a user file (example "emeric.ini").
The name of file is the name of user.
All users files must be in "users" directory in root config directory (where 
"ppftpconf.ini" is).
